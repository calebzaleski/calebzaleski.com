this is my website I host with nginx. it is a simple dashboard for all my projects and daily needs. It is very much a work in progress. it has right now 3 API's. a Bible verse of the day, a quote of the day and a random way to say no to someone. The idea behind devepling this was top ahve it be a startup page for me whenever I open the safari so that i have all the info I might need right there.
